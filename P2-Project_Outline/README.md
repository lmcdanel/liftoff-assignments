## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	This web application allows users to keep track of craft beers that they've tried. Each user will have a collection of beers they've tried, rated, and given a description of as well as viewing the label and description from the brewery itself. After ranking a few beers and finding out what the user likes about the beers they've tried, the application will suggest other beers that it thinks they will enjoy. A user can develop a network of "friends" and see the beers they've tried and liked for another form of inspiration and suggestion. This app is useful because it allows users to really dive into their beer palate and start to branch out with beers and breweries they may have never been exposed to before. The idea stems from my love of craft beer and the thrill of finding new things to try.

### Features
	-User signup/login - Users will be able to create an account that stores all of the beers they've tried and what they thought of them. (ratings/description)
	- Search - Users will be able to search for the beers they've tried so they can log them in their account.
	- App suggestion - Based on the ratings of the beers in a users profile, the app will search for a beer and suggest it to try next. *Maybe suggest breweries/beers closest first?
	- Wild card? - Users will be able to hit a button that generates a random beer outside of the suggestion feature.
	- Network of Users/Profiles - Users will be able to find their friends and see what they have been trying!

### Technologies
    - JavaScript
	- SpringBoot
	- MySQL
	- Bootstrap (of sorts?)

### What I'll Have to Learn
	- Fully integrating an API that can display the labels, description of the beers, the brewery, location of the brewery, brewery website?
	- Randomly generate info from the api for the "wild card"
	- Generate a suggestion based on what the user likes
